GEOCARB_NET: Getting STARTED

* Make a sub-directory named c:\Geocarb_Net (unless existing already)
* Download all the files and copy them to c:\Geocarb_Net’
* Run the main program by clicking ‘GEOCARB_NET2023’ [right-click 'Pin to Start' or 'Add to Favorites' to start later]

When starting the program (security reasons), the windows system may warn you not to ‘Run File’. Click on ‘Info’ and a new message will appear and the click ‘Run anyway’. This will only happen once.


CONFIGURE the system
Before you can operate the software you must install R on your computer.

* In the program select ‘Organize’ and Configure’ and type the 'Location of R' (i.e., location of R.exe) in the text box.

‘c:\program files\r\r-4.2.3\bin\r.exe’ is the default location when downloading R but this may require administrative password, so you could put R somewhere else and the configure the system.
